# 1. If define class constructor in parent class and create a Instance of child class, class constructor of 
#    PARENT class get called automatically.

# 2. If define class constructor in  both parent class and child class and create a Instance of child class,
#    class constructor of CHILD class get called automatically.

# 3. First preference will be always  child class constructor
